# Trust me bro

This is a C file that will output "42\n" but with a twist... it does that by
only using a random number, binary or, division and binary shifts.

That means absolutely zero strings and zero number literals.

*Of course write is used but yeah you get the gist of it*

## Content

[main.c](main.c) contains the final version of that project (basically
unreadable).

[debug.c](debug.c) contains the code used to craft the final version (you might
be able to get something out of it).

## Credits

This was made in collaboration with @ManiGillier between 5 and 7am on a Friday
while under heavy sleep deprivation.

It was insanely fun to do, and the only thing we would like to improve would be
to remove the need for the division (we couldn't get a one without a division
:/).
